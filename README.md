- **Project 1 (Initial Version)**  
  Aims to combine machine learning and finite element analysis for modulus prediction, with a focus on data exploration based on Random Forest (RF) models and model derivation.

- **Project 2**  
  Key features include:  
  - Considering the similarities and differences among "aspect ratio", "width", and "height", and exploring the impact of different independent variables on prediction results under the same model;  
  - Incorporating Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and XGBoost models;  
  - Conducting initial development of the UI interface.

- **Project 3**  
  Key optimizations and features:  
  - Optimizing dataset partitioning from `training set:test set = 8:2` to `training set:validation set:test set = 7:1.5:1.5` to prevent overfitting;  
  - Implementing model output and reasonable data storage;  
  - Carrying out effective development of the user interface.

- **Project 4 (English Version of Project 3.0)**  
  All codes have been translated into English to facilitate internationalization and open-source sharing.


- **The Funcation of UI Page**
  The user interaction interface has been saved and is provided for viewing only.
